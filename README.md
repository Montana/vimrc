# vimrc

To install my (Montana Mendy's) `.vimrc` just clone this repository to `.vim` in your root folder. Just remember to backup your current `.vimrc` and `.vim` folder if you don't want to lose your files.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Montana/vimrc.git
cd vim
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

I've also added an install script, if you're too lazy to install.

```sh
chmod 777
sh install-vimrc.sh
```
